# Aggie-Image-Viewer
This is a project from my Intro to Programming Concepts and Design class. It is an image viewer built using FLTK.  
The images that are cycled through in the viewer are located in the "Images" folder, along with the name of the txt files in "images.txt".  
Users can cycle through the pictures using the buttons in the viewer, the left and right arrow keys, the "n" (next) and "p" (previous) keys, or the tab (next) and backspace (previous) keys. The number of times each picture is viewed, as well as the number of times the next and previous buttons have been pressed is stored and outputted in the command line.
